This is just to remember issues I'm personally having (so I'll remember them when I continue this ones of the days)
- Not certain on how I see which party is GO (likely needed for multi connectivity)
- Wifi Direct Scanning does not work on my phones
- I'm not getting service advertising working event with PC
- I can not see hidden networks with Wifi Scanning
- Wifi Scanning is not working with my phones
